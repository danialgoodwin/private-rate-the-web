# Private Rate The Web
Browser extension to help you keep track of which pages you've read and whether or not you've liked them.

Created for myself, may be helpful for others too.

## Features
- Mark webpages as read and optionally rate them too.

Maybe eventual features:
- Ability to see see ratings on links before clicking and travelling to them
- Admin ratings?
- Ability to flag/report pages for the community?
    - Maybe record clicks that are cancelled? Reason: User may not know for sure, but admin could double-check
- Ability to export data
- Ability to add notes to pages
- Ability to see average rating of page from all recent users (1 year?), definitely anonymized information
- Ability to see similar pages that people have liked? Meh

Possible alternative names:
- Rate The Web
- Personal Rate The Web
- Mark As Read and Rate
- Private Mark As Read And Rate
- Read and Rate
